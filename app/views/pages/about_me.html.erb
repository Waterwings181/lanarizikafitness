        <p style="font-size:1.5em;line-height:30px;">
            Years of dance, running, and weight training have kept Lana feeling strong and fit. It was 
            after a brief setback in 2014 (she had a stress fracture in her hip) that she fully understood 
            how vital exercise was to her overall well-being. More importantly, she was inspired to teach 
            others how to make fitness an enjoyable part of life so they too can realize all its physical 
            and mental health benefits. Fitness, she believes, is a game changer.<br><br>
            Lana received her Personal Trainer Certification from NASM and continues her education through 
            classes, seminars, and various training programs. She weight trains several times a week, mixes 
            in cardio workouts, and dedicates time to her new passion, boxing!   </p>
